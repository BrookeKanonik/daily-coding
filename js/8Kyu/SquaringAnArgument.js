//Instructions:

/*
Now you have to write a function that takes an argument and returns the square of it.
* @param {number} number - the number we would like to square 
* @return {number} number squared - the number we squared 
*/

//Initial code (works and is best practice):

function square (num){ //our parameter will always need to be a number (may be negative) 
return num * num //can also write as an arrow function but both are proper 
}

//result: we will need to return the number squared
//example: 5 -> 25
